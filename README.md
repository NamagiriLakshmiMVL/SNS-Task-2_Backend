I have Implemented CRUD operation in the title PROJECT MANAGEMENT.
API endpoints are secured with middleware AUTH which sends a token to the user when logged in and each time the API call is hitten, only if the token is valid next operation is performed.
Password is hashed using bcryptjs package and it is stored as hashed password.

Here's the Postman implementation of the API written :
1. Creating a Project
